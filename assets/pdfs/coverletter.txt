Dear Recruiting Manager, 
Greetings!
I am currently a Graduate Student at Syracuse University, pursuing Masters in Computer Engineering, set to graduate in May 2018. I do not have any full time work experience (except a few internships) as I am a fresher. Right after my undergraduate in india, I came to the US to pursue my masters. But I am always enthusiastic to learn more. Throughout my academic career, I have maintained an impressive GPA, and for the past 6 months I have been working under Dr. Fawcett as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for 2 core courses (based on C++ and C# .NET programming and Object Oriented Software designing) of the Masters Program in Computer Engineering at Syracuse University. I worked on a few Java projects back in my undergraduate program but throughout my masters program, I have been deeply involved with a lot of C++ and C# .NET projects, on a wide range of topics and complexity. 
I believe, collectively with all my previous internship experience and my academic performance, I would be a strong assest at SRC. Also, it would be a starting point to my career and I would get to learn a lot, and it would help me progress as a successful Software Developer.
